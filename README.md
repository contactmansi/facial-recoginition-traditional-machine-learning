# Facial Recognition using Traditional Machine Learning

## Setup guidelines for project:

1. Setup new virtual environment for running facial recognition using basic machine learning jupyter notebook using on Windows. Refer my [post](https://contactmansi.github.io/workoutdata/markdown/2022/01/29/Virtual-Environment-Jupyter-Notebook.html) for a quick setup.
2. Once the virtual environment has been created and activated, install all required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Place `FisherFace.py` and `face` folder containing all dataset images in the same directory as source jupyter notebook
4. To add new virtual environment to existing jupyter notebook setup on windows, follow this [post](https://contactmansi.github.io/workoutdata/markdown/2022/01/29/Virtual-Environment-Jupyter-Notebook.html) till the end.
